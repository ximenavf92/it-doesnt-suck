[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/e0beeb61-b1f4-488f-9b11-a1637018a8c8/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/it-doesnt-suck/deploys)

Rebuilding the [**Top Shelf® Organic**](https://topshelforganic.com) page, originally built in wordpress, using the static site generator: [**Eleventy**](https://11ty.io/). The goal is to improve performance, accesibility and reduce bloat while learning how to use **Eleventy**. The site will be deployed in [**Netlify**](https://netlify.com) and will use advantage of [**Netlify CMS**](https://www.netlifycms.org/).
